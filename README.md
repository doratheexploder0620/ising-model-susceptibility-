# ising-model-susceptibility-
basically a simulation of the ising model , with many parameters that let you see everything from magnetization to phase transitions to divergences in the susceptibility .

if youre a student and want to get a feeling for phase transitions and divergences in the susceptibilty , this is good for that 
just copy the code and run it in your browser , nothing more nothing less .

you can use the pause thermal button to pause the simulation 
  then you can click the activate flipper button to then go and selecta region on the plane whose spins you want to flip 
  then you can deactivate the slipper and resume the thermal to see how the disturbance that you have created propogates 

youll find that the distrbances that you create die down and do not propogate in the ordered phase 
and you can see that as you get near to the critical point , they become more dispersyy
essentially showing long range correlations 

i made it so that i could see these things that you derive in statistical mechanics 
you can also plot the susceptibility vs t graph and see that it kind of diverges( peaks) around the ctritical temperature 

pretty straight forward
share it with people if you want to
